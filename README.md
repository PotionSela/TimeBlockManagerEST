## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application designed to help you schedule your workday effectively. It provides a visual representation of hours throughout the day, allowing you to add and save events for specific time blocks. The application also highlights the current hour and differentiates past, present, and future time blocks.

## Features

- Display of current date and time.
- Color-coded time blocks to indicate past, present, and future events.
- Ability to add and save events for each time block.
- Local storage to persist event information between visits.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need a web browser.

### Installation

## Usage
